// 1- Install the plugin
// 2- Enable web service advance feature (Admin > Advanced features)
// 3- Enable XMLRPC protocol (Admin > Plugins > Web services > Manage protocols)
// 4- Create a token for a specific user and for the service 'My service' (Admin > Plugins > Web services > Manage tokens)
// 5- Run this script directly from your browser: you should see 'Hello, FIRSTNAME'
